# Make Art With Python

The project comprises of three individual different tasks . Initially , it takes a picture into account and then a pixel-sort algorithm is applied to it after the picture is sorted , for every pixels its sound frequency is calculated and stored in an audio file . The last part of the project includes creating an audio-visualizer like effect with the help of matplotlib circular bar plot with different frequencies range . In the end , a video is made by combining all the elements with the help of ffmpeg commands . 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
